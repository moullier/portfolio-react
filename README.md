# Portfolio (React)

## Description

This project is a new version of my portfolio, created using the React library to build the UI.  It uses the React Router to present the three different "pages".  It is responsive to the size of the browser viewing the site, so when it is viewed on a smaller screen such as a phone, the information displayed will adjust.  At this time, the projects page displays screenshots and links to our first two group project assignements, and two homework assignments that demonstrate my increasing Javascript experience.  The Contact page contains contact information, a link to my GitHub and LinkedIn accounts, and a link to my resume.

The primary CSS framework used in designing this site is Bootstrap.  The site is laid out using the Bootstrap grid, which makes it simple to lay out pages using rows and columns, and makes it possible to change the layout on the fly for different browser window sizes.  Bootstrap also contains some pre-formatted components such as cards, and I used some of these as well.
